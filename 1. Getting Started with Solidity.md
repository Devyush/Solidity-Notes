## **INTRODUCTION TO SOLIDITY**
In this ever changing world, most professional programmers use one or more popular programming languages.
This includes C, Python, Java, and more.
Here comes Solidity! Yet another programming language.
Solidity was designed to be easy to learn for programmers that are already familiar with one or more modern programming languages.
### **What is Solidity?**
Solidity is a JavaScript-like object-oriented programming language.
Solidity was created by Ethereum’s team and introduced in 2014.
It is also called a contract-oriented programming language.
### **Purpose of Solidity**
Solidity is designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Solidity is compiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM.
With Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.
### **What is EVM?**
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a platform that makes creating decentralized applications easier.
It is global, so you can access projects from anywhere in the world.
EVM is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution.
It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
### **Why Solidity?**
Let’s understand what makes it superior.  
**Functional :** Solidity language is used for smart contracts. This mostly takes care of money-related needs (such as auctions, crowdfunding, or wallets). However, we can create other applications too (say, for voting).  
**Flexible :** You can use a Remix online compiler or download a command-line compiler on your PC to write smart contracts. Both of these options are absolutely free.  
**Promising :** The world spends billions on blockchain solutions every year. While most of it comes from financial companies, all kinds of businesses use Blockchain. That puts skilled Solidity developers in extremely high demand.  
**Improving :** Solidity language updates, such as new features and bug fixes, are introduced constantly.
## **WHAT ARE SMART CONTRACTS?**
A smart contract is a self-executing contract where the terms and conditions are defined and enforced using the software.
Smart contracts are generally stored and secured using blockchain technology.
It is smart because the software is doing something automatically once the conditions are met.
### **How Does a Smart Contract Work?**
Assume that Jai wants to buy Bhanu’s house. This agreement is formed on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract.
This smart contract contains an agreement between Jai and Bhanu.
In the simplest terms, the agreement will look like this: “WHEN Jai pays Bhanu 300$, THEN Jai will receive ownership of the house”.
Once this smart contract agreement has been put into place, it cannot be changed meaning Jai can feel safe to pay Bhanu 300$ for the house.
### **Without a smart contract**
Let’s assume if we don’t use smart contracts.
Without the use of a smart contract in this scenario, Bill and John would have to pay lots of fees to third-party companies.
Including the bank, a lawyer, and a house broker.
### **Benefit**
No more commissions and no more delays to wait for a lawyer and broker to process the agreement!
This is just one of many examples of how a smart contract can be used.
Smart contracts are automatically executed once the conditions of the agreement are met.
