## **THE REMIX IDE**
### **Introduction**
While learning Solidity, it is very handy to use an integrated development environment (IDE).
While learning Solidity, it is very handy to use an integrated development environment (IDE).
Most of them support testing and help you debug your code as well.
This allows beginners to write contracts that work properly.
Remix Solidity online compiler is open-source and written in JavaScript.
Remix Ethereum IDE is not the only option available, it is considered to be the best for Solidity newbies.
It lets you go through the smart contract step by step and simplifies the debugging process.
It is also much quicker to get started with.
### **Layout**
As you open Remix Solidity online compiler in your browser, you will see the layout consists of four basic parts.  

On the left, you have the **Icon Panel**.  
In it, you can choose a plugin you wish to see in the **Swap Panel**.  
* **Plugins :** Here are some of the most common plugins:
    * Compiler: Compiles a contract
    * Run & Deploy: Sends a transaction
    * Debugger: Debugs a transaction
    * Analysis : Presents data of the last compilation

**Main Panel:** It allows you to view and edit files in multiple tabs. It highlights Solidity keywords, making it easier to grasp the syntax.
The panel recompiles the code after each change and saves it a few seconds after the last one is finished.  
**Terminal:** You can see the results and run your code in the Terminal. It shows all the important operations and transactions mined currently.
You can also search for specific data and clear logs in the Terminal.
### **History of Solidity**
Let’s have a look at the history of Solidity.
When it was first launched, Remix was called Browser Solidity.
The Remix team allows you to access the alpha version of their online Solidity compiler.
Alpha is a version that is ready for testing, but not for a public release. Using the alpha version, you can see the newest features of the IDE.
However, as this version is still being developed, it guarantees no stability.
You are welcome to play around with it, but don’t use it for important projects.
The official version of the Remix Solidity online compiler receives updates only when they are verified for public release. This ensures it is stable and safe to use.
### **How about using it Offline?**
Even though Remix is a Solidity browser compiler, you can use it without Internet access as well.
For that, you will need to download Remix IDE on your computer.
The latest Remix version can always be found on GitHub.
After you download the .zip file, you will have to unzip it and find the index.html file.
After you open it using your browser, you will be able to access Remix IDE offline.
