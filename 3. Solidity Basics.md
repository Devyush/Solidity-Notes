## **YOUR FIRST SMART CONTRACT**
Before we start creating smart contracts let’s just have a glance at solidity tools.
Solidity tools are required to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts programmed in Solidity.
### **Tools**
**TestNet:** The choice of TestNet on which you have to work on, remember to use some specified network ID.  
**Compiler:** Choosing the compiler as per the requirement. For example, solc is a solidity compiler. It is included in most of the nodes and also available as a standalone package.  
**Web3.js:** Web.js is a library. It helps in the connection between the Ethereum network and our App via HTTP or the IPC network connection.  
**Framework:** It is important to choose a framework from those available for contract compilation and the deployment and other tasks. Some of the frameworks used are Truffle, Embark, Dapple, and others.
### **Define the version**
In solidity, the first line must always state its current version.
I will suggest you to specify the version of a solidity file at the start of the source file to avoid any conflict.
This is achieved by the Pragma version. It is defined at the start of the solidity file.
So that any person looking to run the file knows about the previous version.
Take a look at how to define a version
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.7;
```
### **What is Pragma?**
Pragma tells that the source code is written for Solidity version 0.5.7 or anything newer.
A pragma directive is always local to a source file and if you import another file, the pragma from that file will not automatically apply to the importing file.
### **First Contract**
```
contract House{ 	
	//Insert contract logic here 
}
```
Each new contract must be prepended with “contract”,
The name of the contract should have the first letter always capitalized, followed by open/close curly brackets to contain the logic.
## **WHAT ARE COMMENTS?**
Creating a contract was simple, right?
Now, what if our contract consists of more than 100 lines?
So, to remember what every block of code or a method do we can also include comments. Comments help us describe our code.
Comments are used to give a short description of our program.
Comments are ignored by the computer at the time of execution.
There are two types of comments.
* **Single line comments :** It starts with a double slash (//). It applies comment to a single line only.
* **Multiline comments:** It starts with /* and ends with */. Multiline comments are used for large text descriptions.
### **New comment style**
Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables, and more.
This special form is named the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec).
In solidity, there is a new comment style called Natspec Comment.
In this type of comment we can either use /// or /** … */. Natspec Comments do not apply to variables, even if the variables are public.
Some tags are used in Natspec Comment.
### **Tags**
* @title - Title for the Smart contract
* @author - Author of the Smart contract
* @notice - Explanation of the function
* @dev - Explanation to developer
* @param - Explanation of a parameter
* @return - Explanation of the return type
## **STRUCTURE OF A CONTRACT**
In Solidity every contract is similar to the concept of classes.
Also, contracts can inherit from other contracts.
A contract can contain a declaration such as:
* State variable
* Functions
* Function modifiers
* Events
### **What are State variables?**
State variables are the variables whose values are permanently stored in the contract storage.
For example,
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.07; 
contract Ph { 
uint storedData; // State variable 
// … 
}
```
### **Function in Solidity**
Before we use a function, we need to define it.
In solidity, the common way to define a function is by using the function keyword.
Basic syntax is:
```
function function-name(parameter-list) scope returns() {    
	//statements 
}
```
In Solidity functions can be called internally or externally
Let’s understand with a example,
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.07; 
contract Ph {  
function joker() public Bat { // Function  
// …  
} 
}
```
### **What are Function modifiers?**
Basically, modifiers are used to change the way functions work.
You can set a condition to check before the function execution.  
**Note:** Contracts inherit modifiers, but related contracts can suspend these properties.  

Let’s take an example.
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.07; 
contract owned {     
	constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }     
	address payable owner;     
	modifier onlyOwner {         
		require(             
			msg.sender == owner,             
			"Only owner can call this function."         
		);         
		_;     
	} 
}
```
In the previous example, the contract does not use the modifier, only defines it.
The derived contracts will use the modifier.
The function body is inserted in the place the special symbol _; is in the modifier definition.
When the owner calls this function, it executes. Otherwise, it throws an exception.
## **DATA TYPES IN SOLIDITY**
### **Introduction**
In various programming languages, you need to use various variables to store various information.
What are the variables?
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
It means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
### **Data Types**
We can store various data types such as
* **Boolean:** This type of data type has two values, either true or false,
For example:  
```
bool b = false;
```

* **Integers:** There are two subtypes of integers int and uint.
Signed integer and Unsigned integer types respectively.
Memory size is allocated at compile time; it is to be specified using int8 or int256, where the number represents the size allocated in the memory. Allocating memory by just using int or uint, by default assigns the largest memory size.
* **Address:** Address data types hold the 20-byte value representing the size of an Ethereum address.
### **What’s the use of Address data type?**
An address data type can be used to get the balance.
This can be used by using the .balance method and can be used to transfer .balance to another address using the .transfer method.
For example,
```
address x = 0x212; 
address myAddress = this; 
if (x.balance < 10 && myAddress.balance >= 10) x.transfer(10);
```
