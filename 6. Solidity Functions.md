## **WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
A function is a bunch of reusable code.
A function can be called anywhere in a program.
### **Why?**
Function eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again.
Functions divide a big program into several small and manageable functions.
### **How to define it?**
To define a function in Solidity we use the function keyword.
A function keyword with a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.
The basic syntax to define a function is:
```
function function-name(parameter-list) scope returns() {    
	//statements 
}
```
### **What is View Function?**
View functions ensure that they will not modify the state.
You can declare a function as a view.
There are some statements if present in the function, are considered modifying the state and the compiler will throw a warning in such cases.
The statements are as follows:
* Modifying state variables
* Emitting events
* Creating other contracts
* Calling any function which is not marked view

Example:
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0; 
contract Test {    
	function getResult() public view returns(uint product, uint sum){       
		uint a = 1; // local variable       
		uint b = 2;       
		product = a * b;       
		sum = a + b;     
	} 
}
```
`0: uint256: product 2 1: uint256: sum 3`
### **Pure Function**
Similar to the view function there is pure function!
Pure functions make sure that they not read or modify the state.
A function can be declared as pure.
Pure functions can use the revert() and require() functions to revert potential state changes if an error occurs.
