## **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**
### **What are Operators?**
In a programming language, an operator is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform the specific mathematical, logical operation and produce the final result.
### **Arithmetic Operators**
The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, increment, modulus, and decrement.
* **Addition (+):** The addition operator adds two operands.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20.
Eg: a + b=30
* **Subtraction (-):** The Subtraction operator subtracts the second operand from the first.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20.
Ex: a - b=-10
* **Multiplication (*):** The Multiplication operator multiplies both operands.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20.
Ex: a * b=200
* **Division (/):** The Division operator divides the numerator by the denominator.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20.
Ex: b / a=2
* **Increment (++):** The Increment operator increases an integer value by one.
Assume variable a=10
Ex: a++=11
* **Decrement (--):** The decrement operator decreases an integer value by one
Assume variable a=10
Ex: a--=9
## **COMPARISON & LOGICAL OPERATORS**
### **What are Comparison Operators?**
Operators that compare values and return true or false are called Comparison operators.
Solidity supports various comparison operators.
### **Comparison Operator**
* **Equal (==):** Equal operator checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.
Let’s say variable x=10 and variable y= 20
Ex: (x == y) is not true.
* **Not Equal (!=):** Not Equal operator checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
Let’s say variable x =10 and variable y=20
Ex: (x != y) is true.
* **Greater than (>):** Greater than operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.
Let’s take an example where x=10 and y=20
Ex: (x > y) is not true.
* **Less than (<):** Less than operator checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.
Let’s take an example where x=10 and y=20
Ex: (x < y) is true.
* **Greater than or Equal to (>=):** Greater than or Equal to operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.
Let’s say variable x=10 and variable y= 20
Ex: (x >= y) is not true.
* **Less than or Equal to (<=):** Less than or Equal to operator checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.
Let’s say variable x =10 and variable y=20
Ex: (x <= y) is true.
### **What are Logical operators?**
Logical operators are operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values.
Logical operators provide a single boolean output.
### **Logical operators**
* **Logical AND (&&):** Logical AND operator checks if both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20
Ex: (a && b) is true.
* **Logical OR (||):** Logical OR checks if any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20
Ex: (a || b) is true.
* **Logical NOT (!):** Logical NOT operator reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the Logical NOT operator will make it false.
Assume variable a=10 and variable b=20
Ex: ! (a && b) is false.
