## **LOOPS IN SOLIDITY**
### **What are Loops?**
Loops are among the most basic and powerful programming concepts.
A loop in a computer program is an instruction that repeats until a specified condition is reached.
In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer requires action, it is executed.
### **while Loop**
The most basic loop in Solidity is the while loop.
The main motive of the while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true.
Syntax of while loop in Solidity:
```
while (expression) {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true 
}
```
### **do...while Loop**
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop.
The only difference is that the condition check happens at the end of the loop.
It means that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
Syntax of do...while loop:
```
do {    
	Statement(s) to be executed; 
} while (expression);
```
### **for Loop**
The for loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes:
* The **loop initialization** where we initialize a starting value.
* The **test statement** will test if a given condition is true or not.
* The **iteration statement** where you can increase or decrease your counter.

Syntax of for loop:
```
for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement) {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true 
}
```
## **DECISION MAKING**
When writing a program, there may come a situation when you need to choose one out of a given set of paths.
In that case, you simply need to use conditional statements.
It allows your program to make correct decisions and perform the right actions.
Solidity supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
### **if statement**
In if statements the given statements are executed if the resulting value is true.
If the expression is false, then no statement would be executed.
More often you will use comparison operators while making decisions.
The syntax for a basic if statement is:
```
if (expression) {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true 
}
```
### **if...else statement**
The 'if...else' statement is the next form of control statement.
If the resulting value is true, the given statements in the 'if' block are executed.
If the expression is false, then the given statements in the else block are executed.
```
 if (expression) {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true 
} else {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false 
}
```
### **if...else if... statement**
The if...else if... statement is an advanced form of if...else.
There is nothing special about this code.
It is just a series of if statements, where each if is a part of the else clause of the previous statement.
Syntax:
```
if (expression 1) {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true 
} else if (expression 2) {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true 
} else {    
	Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true 
}
```
